				<section>
					<p>Imagine a web of lectures, videos, interactive content, and more on hundreds of topics. Each skill you learn linked to higher skills.
						But more than just building up, but a system that can help you find holes in your knowledge, and direct you to content that
						can help you fill those gaps.
						Imagine a system that could keep track of what skills you'd learning, could reccomend topics for further learning or even
						suggest entirely new paths.</p>
					<p> Finally, imagine this as not a small collection of videos or lectures, but a world wide source for learning. Allowing anyone
						to add content, link educational videos they found, or anything else they found. Instructions from thousands of sources on anything
						you could want to learn. From Math to CS, Art, History, and How to maintain your car.</p>
					<p> Sadly, I don't know enough about how to code, but I am learning everyday a little bit more. I still have
						a long way to go though. Hopefully one day this can be built well enough that it truley can be a universal learning tool that
						anyone can add to. As of yet even an account to keep track of what you've learned is beyond me, but the vision is there. Maybe
						once I get this big enough people start adding content they've found, I'll be able to use it to learn how to build the site
						the rest of the way >D.</p>
